        Please add a *minimal, reproducible example* that can reproduce the error when running it.

        Be as succinct as possible, **do not depend on external data files**, instead use synthetically generated data or one of the datasets provided by [sksurv.datasets](
        https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/datasets.html).

        In short, **we are going to copy-paste your code** to run it and we expect to get the same result as you.

        Please follow [this guide](https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports) on how to
        provide a minimal, reproducible example.

        Example:
        ```python
        from sksurv.datasets import load_whas500
        from sksurv.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
        from sksurv.linear_model import CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis

        X, y = load_whas500()

        features = OneHotEncoder().fit_transform(X)
        cph_model = CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis(alphas=[0.01, 0.1, 1.0])
        cph_model.fit(features, y)
        ```

        Please provide verbose output that clearly demonstrates the problem the reproducible example shows.

        If you observe an error, please paste the error message including the **full traceback** of the exception. For instance the code above raises the following exception:

        ```python-traceback
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
        File my_bug_report.py:8
              5 X, y = load_whas500()
              7 features = OneHotEncoder().fit_transform(X)
        ----> 8 cph_model = CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis(alphas=[0.01, 0.1, 1.0])
              9 cph_model.fit(features, y)

        TypeError: CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'alphas'. Did you mean 'alpha'?
